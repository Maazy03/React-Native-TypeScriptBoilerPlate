## Usage

### Copy the structure to your project

You can create your project and then copy the `/src` folder (which has all the code of your application) and update your `index.js`.

Keep in mind that if you do this, you'll have to **install and link** all dependencies (as well as adding all the necessary native code for each library that requires it).

## Folder structure

This template follows a very simple project structure:

- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside your application.
  - `store`: Folder to put all redux middlewares,actions,store and reduxtoolkit services.
     - `services`: This folder contains the RTK Query mutations and queries
     - `auth`:This folder contain the action and reducer
  - `assets`: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, etc.
  - `components`: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button)
     - `common`: This folder contains all the reuseable components like TextInput,Text,DropDown and much more.
     - `constants`:This folder contain all the dummy data that is used for sole purpose of frontend designing,
     - `layout`: This folder contains all the layout HOC that will be used all over the application.This includes ScreenBoiler,Auth Boiler,ScrollContainer,FormScrollContainer and much more
     - `utils`: This folder contains all the utility modules and reuseable functions that can be used throughout the application
       - `CustomHooks`:This folder contains the custom hooks.
       - `Form Validation`: This folder contains the form validators.
       - `Color`: This file contains the colors declared for the purpose of styling.
       - `Styles`: This file contains all the global reuseable styles that will be used throughout the application.
       - `Unit`: This file contains the resposnive units that you call throughout the entire applications for the purpose of making the fonts,height,width responsive.
       - `Image`: This file contains all the images imported and declared.
       - `Svg`:This file contains all the SVGS imported and declared.
       - `R`: The Global accessor with which you can access all the above mentioned Colors,Unit,Image,Styles.
     - `view`: This folder is further divided into two more parts.
       - `Cards`: You have the flexibility to create reusable card within this folder.
       - `Modal`: You have the flexibility to create modals within this folder.
  - `containers`: This folder contains the screens and is further categorized into two more folders
     - `authContainer`:This folder contains all the authentications screens that will be showed before logging in.
     - `appContainer`: This folder contains all the screens that will be shown when authentications will be completed.
  - `navigation`: Folder to store the navigators.
    - `appStack` : File containing the application stack navigation.
    - `authStack`: File containing the auth stack navigation.
  - `App.js`: Main component that starts your whole app.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of your application as per React-Native standards.

## Splash screen customization

To customize the splash screen (logo and background color) use the CLI provided in the [official docs](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash#assets-generation).

## Generate production version

These are the steps to generate `.apk`, `.aab` and `.ipa` files

### Android

1. Generate an upload key
2. Setting up gradle variables
3. Go to the android folder
4. Execute `./gradlew assemble[Env][BuildType]`

Note: You have three options to execute the project
`assemble:` Generates an apk that you can share with others.
`install:` When you want to test a release build on a connected device.
`bundle:` When you are uploading the app to the Play Store.

For more info please go to https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android

### iOS

1. Go to the Xcode
2. Select the schema
3. Select 'Any iOS device' as target
4. Product -> Archive

For more info please go to https://reactnative.dev/docs/publishing-to-app-store

## Styleguide

In our React Native project, we harness the power of Stylesheet styling to ensure a well-organized and efficient approach to defining and managing styles.

# How to use it

The idea of this section is to explain how the template composition is the best and easiest to use when you try to use well-formed, architectures, especially using redux flow.

The template follows a simple and convenient exporting pattern. The folder index exposes the resources, allowing to import all from the same path.

With that in mind, we are going to look at each folder to explain how to use it.

## Components

Components are the basic blocks of a react native application, but since we​​ aim to minimize development complexity, all the components are at the same nesting level.

Another important thing is the use of propTypes to check the kind of data that your components need to work properly. If the component receives some data from others, the type of these props must be defined, and in case you need it the default value of the property too.

### Static resources:

To keep an application scalable and organized, the global static resources that are used in the application have to be created in a specific file.

### We manage three main folders for that:

- Assets: Here you can store all the images and icons that you need through the app. You have as an example the icon ic_home.png, to respond with the different device screen densities just create inside the same folder the image and all the scaled versions that you need. RN only handles x1, x2 and x3 in this case, you have.

  - assets
    - ic_home
      - ic_home.png
      - ic_home@2x.png
      - ic_home@3x.png

- Localization: This folder contains all the locale objects that you need to create a multilingual application. Create a file for each locale, inside define an object then maintain the nesting sorted by the screen that contains the text that you need and the text you want to show. As the last step, remember to create a reference inside the Localization.js file and add it to LocalizedStrings.
- Theme: Here you can define all the styles that you use on different screens. To make easier the interaction of the application with device options for example you can create here assets as light and dark color palette

## Redux

Once the components are defined, they are tied to the management of information through the application. For this, Redux is implemented with the store-reducer-action structure as usual, however, not only the data is handled through the actions but the success and error responses are also defined by the same form.

### Controllers folder and API connection handler

To keep the networking layer simple, the template uses a single Axios instance in the `httpClient.js`. It uses interceptors to define common side effects for the responses.

When you need communication with a service you have to create a function to manage the operation and grouping according to the kind of transaction inside a controller file, please keep all of those inside the controllers' folder.

While the data transfer between the API and the app is working you must use the success and error actions that help you to catch the result of the operation. With this method, you can track the interaction through the redux store. This is useful because you can create behaviors based on those states in a quick and simple way

### Redux folders

4 folders divide the redux work

- Store: Here you define the store shape and you can configure the persistReducer and middlewares.
- Actions: Remember to create the file and the corresponding test for each action classification. Here you define actions for success and error scenarios.
- Reducers: You have the error and success reducers by default. Create the other classifications and try to keep simple each file. Here you modify the store.
- Selectors: Create one file for each action classification. Here you define what part of the store you need to see in your interface.

## Screens

In this folder, you have the main objects to apply the composition architecture. Just create a folder for each screen you have in your application, call all the components and static resources you need to render the scene and finally use the corresponding hooks to interact with redux and create behaviors depending on the store.

To keep the structure, extract the styles from the main file and place it in a {namefile.styles.js} do the same for the set of tests needed for each screen with the file {namefile.test.js}
